# Lifemiles Technical Test

##How do I Test?
To test the encoder method please execute TechnicalTestApplication.java as normal.
After executing the application, the console will ask for an input to encode. If you are using an IDE, please type on the terminal tab the desired input to test and press enter, after that you will see the encoded output on the console.

##Considerations
The processing has been made parallel using Java's 1.8 parallelStream method of a List, so the output might not be in the same order every run.
